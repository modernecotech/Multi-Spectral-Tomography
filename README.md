# Multi-Spectral-Tomography
Application for the capture and processing of images for shallow depth human tissue tomography. 

This app is the image capture element of the Multi Spectral Tomography.

The system has been tested for shallow depth imaging in retinal tissue. Up to 1.5mm depth. 

It could be modified to image skin or other tissue if the incoherent low power LEDs are replaced by lasers of the same wavelength.
